## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### _Imaging Technique: Double Exposure Photography_

Double exposure blends two distinct images into one, creating a surreal, layered visual effect. This technique is commonly used in photography, film posters, and album covers to combine different concepts or emotions in a single frame.

### _Incorporation_

I wanted to integrate into the project the aspect of double exposure that presents the picture to the viewer at multiple levels. Integrating this effect allows the art to be divided into separate animated parts. Through superposition and fusion, different layers of effects can be seen in the same picture, providing depth and meaning of the work.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### _Coding Technique: Masking and Blend Modes_

Masks allow one image to be shown through parts of another image, while blend mode controls how the two layers are blended. The mask and blend mode implementation sets the content of an element to blend with the content of the element's parent element and the content of the element's background. Masking and blending will help achieve layered images with double exposure, using dynamic transitions to animate individual parts of the artwork.
